The \"to be or not to be\" soliloquy is a solid example. The \"antic disposition\" metaphor for feigned madness. Also, the metaphor of time as a \"ticking clock\" in the play's progression.

Notable examples include the \"play within a play\" as a metaphor for exposing truth, the \"rotten state of Denmark\" symbolizing corruption, and the \"to be or not to be\" soliloquy, where life and death are metaphorically framed as a \"balky\" journey. These metaphors deepen the play's psychological and philosophical complexity.",

Let me start by recalling some key metaphors from the play. There's the famous \"to be or not to be\" soliloquy, which uses metaphors like \"the undiscovered country\" to describe death. Then there are the metaphors related to madness, like when Hamlet says \"I am but mad north-north-west,\" comparing his madness to a direction. Also, the play within a play, \"The Mousetrap,\" uses metaphors related to performance and deception. I need to make sure the analysis is concise but covers these examples. I should mention how these metaphors enhance the themes of mortality, truth, and existential contemplation.

Notable examples include \"the undiscovered country from whose bourn no traveler returns\" (Act 3, Scene 1), framing death as an uncharted realm to underscore Hamlet's existential dread. Metaphors of performance, like \"antic disposition,\" highlight the play's themes of deception and reality. These metaphors deepen the text's exploration of mortality and moral ambiguity.",

Let me start by recalling the key metaphors from the play. There's the famous \"to be or not to be\" soliloquy, which uses metaphors related to existence and suffering. Then there are the recurring themes of disease and decay, like when Hamlet refers to Denmark as a \"prison\" or the \"oppressive state of Denmark.\" \n\nI need to make sure the analysis is concise but covers specific examples. The evaluation guidelines mention depth of textual analysis, quality of examples, and coherence. Since the user wants a very short analysis, I should focus on the most impactful metaphors. The \"play within a play\" is a good example, as it's a metaphor for uncovering truth. Also, the metaphor of disease in describing the corruption of the state and characters.\n\nWait, I should check if I'm addressing all three evaluation criteria. Depth of analysis would involve explaining how metaphors contribute to themes like mortality and moral decay. Quality of examples would include specific instances from the text. Coherence is about how well the analysis is structured and flows. \n\nI need to make sure the examples are relevant and directly tied to the themes. The \"rotten state\" metaphor comes to mind, as well as the metaphor of performance in the play-within-a-play. I should also mention the \"antic disposition\" metaphor. Let me structure this so that each example clearly illustrates the use of metaphor and its thematic significance. \n\nI need to keep it brief, so I'll focus on a few key metaphors and their roles in the play. Let me make sure the analysis is clear and each example is explained in context. Alright, I think that's a solid approach. Let me put it all together concisely.\n</think>\n\nShakespeare employs metaphor in *Hamlet* to explore themes of mortality, corruption, and existential turmoil. Notable examples include the \"play within a play\" metaphor, which serves as a device to expose Claudius's guilt, and the recurring imagery of disease and decay (e.g., \"something is rotten in the state of Denmark\"). These metaphors amplify the play's psychological tension and moral ambiguity, offering layered insights into Hamlet's internal conflict and the broader decay of the Danish court.",
